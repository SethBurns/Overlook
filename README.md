# Overview
This project involved fetching and posting to a locally hosted API that you can download here:
https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api

The project required the ability for users to login through a login page and be able to view previously booked rooms, as well as search to make new bookings by room type and date. Customers can search for available rooms. If there are no rooms available, an apology message is rendered. Customers can then book rooms, receive and confirmation message, and see that new booking appear in their list of booked rooms. A total amount spent is also rendered for each customer, which gets updated as they book more rooms.
